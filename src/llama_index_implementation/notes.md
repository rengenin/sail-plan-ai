### **📌 Best Practices for Multi-Agent System Design**
Designing a multi-agent system (MAS) requires careful consideration of **architecture**, **data flow**, and **scalability**. Below are some best practices based on real-world multi-agent frameworks.

---

## **1️⃣ Key Design Patterns for Multi-Agent Systems**
Here are the most common approaches:

### **1. Actor Model (Message-Passing Agents)**
- Each agent is **independent** and communicates via **asynchronous messages**.
- No shared state; each agent processes tasks **concurrently**.
- Best for **distributed systems** (e.g., using Ray, Celery, or an event-driven architecture).

**Example:**
- **NOAAAgent** → sends tidal data → **WeatherAgent** → sends weather data → **CaptainAgent**  
- Each agent runs as an independent process or microservice.

✅ **Pros**: Highly scalable, resilient to failures, great for real-time tasks.  
❌ **Cons**: Complex debugging, requires message-passing frameworks.  

🛠 **Best tools:**  
- **Ray** (for distributed Python agents)  
- **Celery** (for task queues)  
- **Pulsar/Kafka** (for event-driven communication)  

---

### **2. Functional Workflow (Pipeline Design)**
- Agents act as **functions** in a sequential data pipeline.  
- **One agent processes data, modifies it, and passes it to the next.**  
- **DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)** is often used to define execution flow.

**Example:**
- **NOAAAgent** → `get_tides()`  
- **WeatherAgent** → `get_weather()`  
- **CaptainAgent** → `decide_sailing_conditions()`

✅ **Pros**: Simple, readable, easy to maintain.  
❌ **Cons**: Less flexible than actor-based models, not ideal for real-time systems.  

🛠 **Best tools:**  
- **Prefect / Apache Airflow** (for DAG workflows)  
- **Pydantic** (for data validation)  

---

### **3. Object-Oriented (Class-Based Agents)**
- Each agent is a **class** with methods for data retrieval and decision-making.  
- Best when each agent has **stateful logic** (e.g., caching or tracking past interactions).  
- Works well when integrating multiple APIs.  

**Example:**
```python
class NOAAAgent:
    def get_tides(self, location: str):
        pass

class WeatherAgent:
    def get_weather(self, location: str):
        pass

class CaptainAgent:
    def make_decision(self, tides, weather):
        pass
```

✅ **Pros**: Modular, reusable, and easy to test.  
❌ **Cons**: Can be too rigid for highly dynamic systems.  

🛠 **Best tools:**  
- **Dependency Injection (DI frameworks)** (e.g., FastAPI for modular API-based agents).  

---

## **2️⃣ Choosing the Best Workflow Architecture**
### **✅ Best for Your Use Case: Hybrid DAG + Actor Model**
Your **NOAAAgent, WeatherAgent, and CaptainAgent** could be structured as **independent actors** but connected via a **DAG workflow** for structured execution.

🚀 **Recommended Approach:**
1. **Use DAG for workflow execution** (Airflow or Prefect).  
2. **Use the Actor Model for real-time interactions** (Ray or Celery).  
3. **Encapsulate logic in class-based agents** (OOP).  

---

## **3️⃣ How to Structure the Codebase**
### **🏗 Folder Structure Example**
```
/multi_agent_system
│── agents/
│   ├── noaa_agent.py
│   ├── weather_agent.py
│   ├── captain_agent.py
│── workflows/
│   ├── sailing_decision.py
│── services/
│   ├── api_client.py
│   ├── event_queue.py
│── tests/
│── main.py
```
- **`agents/`** → Contains the individual AI agents.  
- **`workflows/`** → Defines DAG-based execution flows.  
- **`services/`** → Handles API calls and message-passing.  

---

## **4️⃣ Next Steps**
Do you want help implementing **DAG execution (Prefect/Airflow)** or **actor-based messaging (Ray/Celery)?** 🚀

---
### **🚀 Using LangGraph for DAG Execution**
LangGraph is a powerful tool that allows you to build and manage **directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)**, making it a perfect fit for organizing the workflows of multi-agent systems. It can efficiently handle tasks like agent communication and data flow in a graph-based manner.

Let's integrate **LangGraph** into your multi-agent system for **DAG execution**.

---

### **📌 Steps for Implementing DAG Execution with LangGraph**

1. **Define Tasks as Functions**:  
   Each task in your system will be defined as a function that represents a step in the workflow.
   
2. **Create a DAG**:  
   Use LangGraph to organize tasks into a directed acyclic graph where each agent’s task is connected to others based on the data flow.

3. **Execute the Workflow**:  
   Define execution order, where one task is dependent on the previous one (e.g., **NOAAAgent** data is needed before **WeatherAgent**).

---

### **🛠 Example Code Using LangGraph**
We'll define the **NOAAAgent**, **WeatherAgent**, and **CaptainAgent** as tasks in the DAG. LangGraph will orchestrate the flow.

#### 1. **Install LangGraph**

```bash
pip install langgraph
```

#### 2. **Example: Using LangGraph for DAG Execution**
```python
import os
import requests
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langgraph import LangGraph
from langgraph.tasks import Task
from typing import Dict

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

### ✅ 1. Define Tasks (Agents)
def get_noaa_data(station_id: str) -> Dict:
    """Fetch tidal and current data from NOAA API."""
    try:
        url = f"https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/datagetter?product=predictions&datum=MLLW&station={station_id}&time_zone=lst_ldt&units=english&interval=hilo&format=json"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()

        tide_info = {
            "last_tide": data["predictions"][0],
            "next_tide": data["predictions"][1],
        }
        return tide_info
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching NOAA tidal data: {e}")
        return {}

def get_weather_data(lat: float, lon: float) -> Dict:
    """Fetch weather data from NOAA API."""
    try:
        url = f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        forecast_url = data["properties"]["forecast"]

        forecast_response = requests.get(forecast_url)
        forecast_response.raise_for_status()
        forecast_data = forecast_response.json()

        weather_info = {
            "wind_speed": forecast_data["properties"]["periods"][0]["windSpeed"],
            "wind_direction": forecast_data["properties"]["periods"][0]["windDirection"],
            "short_forecast": forecast_data["properties"]["periods"][0]["shortForecast"],
            "temperature": forecast_data["properties"]["periods"][0]["temperature"],
        }
        return weather_info
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching NOAA weather data: {e}")
        return {}

def make_decision(noaa_data, weather_data):
    """Decides if it's safe to sail based on real NOAA & weather data."""
    # Make a sailing decision based on the data.
    if not noaa_data or not weather_data:
        return {"decision": "Unsafe", "reason": "Missing data."}

    tide_safety = "Safe" if noaa_data["last_tide"]["type"] == "H" else "Unsafe"
    wind_speed = int(weather_data["wind_speed"].split()[0])

    if wind_speed > 25:
        return {"decision": "Unsafe", "reason": "High wind speed."}
    
    return {"decision": tide_safety, "reason": "Tide and wind conditions are favorable."}

### ✅ 2. Create LangGraph DAG
def build_sailing_dag():
    """Create a DAG with tasks for NOAA, weather, and captain decisions."""
    graph = LangGraph()

    # Define each task as an agent
    noaa_task = Task(get_noaa_data, station_id="9445958")  # Example station ID
    weather_task = Task(get_weather_data, lat=47.5404, lon=-122.6361)
    decision_task = Task(make_decision)

    # Define task dependencies (order of execution)
    graph.add_edge(noaa_task, weather_task)  # NOAA data is required before weather
    graph.add_edge(weather_task, decision_task)  # Weather data is required for decision

    # Execute the graph
    graph.execute()

    # Return the decision
    decision_result = decision_task.result
    print(f"Sailing Decision: {decision_result['decision']} ({decision_result['reason']})")
    return decision_result

### ✅ 3. Run the DAG
if __name__ == "__main__":
    build_sailing_dag()
```

---

### **🚀 What This Does**
1. **Fetches data** from NOAA and Weather APIs using `get_noaa_data` and `get_weather_data`.
2. Defines **tasks as functions**: 
   - NOAA data task  
   - Weather data task  
   - Captain decision-making task
3. **Creates a LangGraph DAG**:
   - The flow is defined with task dependencies:  
     - NOAA → Weather → Decision
4. **Executes the tasks** in sequence and returns the final decision.

---

### **🛠 Next Steps**
1. **Modularize** the tasks and agents further for extensibility.
2. **Handle retries** in case of API failures or delays.
3. **Integrate additional agents** for other data sources like tides from OpenWeather, etc.

Let me know if you'd like any additional help or more customization in your DAG setup! 🚢🌊

---
### **🚀 Modularizing the Multi-Agent System**

To modularize your system, we'll separate the code into smaller, reusable components. Each agent will have its own module, and we will structure the tasks and data flow in a clean, maintainable way. This will make it easy to extend or modify individual agents without affecting the overall system.

---

### **📂 Proposed Folder Structure**
```
/multi_agent_system
│── agents/
│   ├── noaa_agent.py
│   ├── weather_agent.py
│   ├── captain_agent.py
│── workflows/
│   ├── sailing_dag.py
│── services/
│   ├── api_client.py
│── tests/
│── main.py
```

---

### **🛠 1. Split Code into Modules**
We'll create separate modules for each agent (NOAA, Weather, Captain), define the DAG in its own file, and organize API calls in a `services/` directory.

---

### **📄 1. `noaa_agent.py`**
This will contain the logic for interacting with the NOAA API.

```python
import requests

def get_noaa_data(station_id: str):
    """Fetch tidal and current data from NOAA API."""
    try:
        url = f"https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/datagetter?product=predictions&datum=MLLW&station={station_id}&time_zone=lst_ldt&units=english&interval=hilo&format=json"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()

        tide_info = {
            "last_tide": data["predictions"][0],
            "next_tide": data["predictions"][1],
        }
        return tide_info
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching NOAA tidal data: {e}")
        return {}
```

---

### **📄 2. `weather_agent.py`**
This will contain the logic for fetching weather data from NOAA API.

```python
import requests

def get_weather_data(lat: float, lon: float):
    """Fetch weather data from NOAA API."""
    try:
        url = f"https://api.weather.gov/points/{lat},{lon}"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()
        forecast_url = data["properties"]["forecast"]

        forecast_response = requests.get(forecast_url)
        forecast_response.raise_for_status()
        forecast_data = forecast_response.json()

        weather_info = {
            "wind_speed": forecast_data["properties"]["periods"][0]["windSpeed"],
            "wind_direction": forecast_data["properties"]["periods"][0]["windDirection"],
            "short_forecast": forecast_data["properties"]["periods"][0]["shortForecast"],
            "temperature": forecast_data["properties"]["periods"][0]["temperature"],
        }
        return weather_info
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching NOAA weather data: {e}")
        return {}
```

---

### **📄 3. `captain_agent.py`**
This will contain the logic for the Captain’s decision-making based on data from NOAA and Weather.

```python
def make_decision(noaa_data, weather_data):
    """Decides if it's safe to sail based on real NOAA & weather data."""
    if not noaa_data or not weather_data:
        return {"decision": "Unsafe", "reason": "Missing data."}

    tide_safety = "Safe" if noaa_data["last_tide"]["type"] == "H" else "Unsafe"
    wind_speed = int(weather_data["wind_speed"].split()[0])

    if wind_speed > 25:
        return {"decision": "Unsafe", "reason": "High wind speed."}

    return {"decision": tide_safety, "reason": "Tide and wind conditions are favorable."}
```

---

### **📄 4. `sailing_dag.py` (LangGraph DAG)**
This will define the task flow using LangGraph, where agents are organized in a directed acyclic graph.

```python
from langgraph import LangGraph
from langgraph.tasks import Task
from agents.noaa_agent import get_noaa_data
from agents.weather_agent import get_weather_data
from agents.captain_agent import make_decision

def build_sailing_dag():
    """Create a DAG with tasks for NOAA, weather, and captain decisions."""
    graph = LangGraph()

    # Define each task as an agent
    noaa_task = Task(get_noaa_data, station_id="9445958")  # Example station ID
    weather_task = Task(get_weather_data, lat=47.5404, lon=-122.6361)
    decision_task = Task(make_decision)

    # Define task dependencies (order of execution)
    graph.add_edge(noaa_task, weather_task)  # NOAA data is required before weather
    graph.add_edge(weather_task, decision_task)  # Weather data is required for decision

    # Execute the graph
    graph.execute()

    # Return the decision
    decision_result = decision_task.result
    print(f"Sailing Decision: {decision_result['decision']} ({decision_result['reason']})")
    return decision_result
```

---

### **📄 5. `main.py`**
This will be the entry point of the application, which runs the workflow.

```python
from workflows.sailing_dag import build_sailing_dag

if __name__ == "__main__":
    build_sailing_dag()
```

---

### **🛠 2. Execute the Modularized System**
1. **Run the DAG**:
    - `main.py` will call the **`build_sailing_dag()`** function from **`sailing_dag.py`**.
    - This will trigger the sequence of tasks to gather data from **NOAA**, **Weather**, and make the **sailing decision**.
  
2. **Reusability**:
    - Each agent is now self-contained in its module (`noaa_agent.py`, `weather_agent.py`, `captain_agent.py`).
    - If you want to add a new agent (like a **NewDataAgent** for tides from a different source), you can easily import and integrate it into the **DAG** without modifying other parts of the system.

---

### **💡 Next Steps**
1. **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for each agent in the `/tests/` directory.
2. **Deployment**: Consider deploying this as a service with FastAPI or Flask if you need real-time querying.
3. **Scalability**: If required, deploy the agents in a **distributed** manner using frameworks like **Ray** or **Celery**.

Let me know if you want further details on any part of this setup! 🚢

### With CACHING ###

### **🚀 Adding Caching for NOAA Data**  

Caching will **reduce redundant API calls** and **improve performance**, especially since NOAA data does not change frequently. We can implement caching using **SQLite**, **Redis**, or **disk-based caching** with **`joblib`** or **`diskcache`**.  

For simplicity, let’s use **`diskcache`**, which is lightweight, easy to integrate, and persistent across script executions.  

---

### **📌 Steps to Implement Caching**
1. **Install `diskcache`**:  
   ```bash
   pip install diskcache
   ```
2. **Modify NOAA Agent to Cache API Responses**  
   - Cache responses for **a set duration** (e.g., 1 hour).
   - If data exists in the cache, return it **instead of making an API call**.

---

### **📄 Update `noaa_agent.py` to Use Caching**
```python
import requests
import diskcache as dc
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

# Initialize cache (stores data on disk, default expiration: 1 hour)
cache = dc.Cache("./cache")  # Cache stored in ./cache directory

def get_noaa_data(station_id: str):
    """Fetch tidal and current data from NOAA API with caching."""
    
    cache_key = f"noaa_data_{station_id}"
    
    # Check if data is in cache
    if cache_key in cache:
        print("Returning cached NOAA data.")
        return cache[cache_key]

    try:
        url = f"https://api.tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/prod/datagetter?product=predictions&datum=MLLW&station={station_id}&time_zone=lst_ldt&units=english&interval=hilo&format=json"
        response = requests.get(url)
        response.raise_for_status()
        data = response.json()

        tide_info = {
            "last_tide": data["predictions"][0],
            "next_tide": data["predictions"][1],
        }

        # Store data in cache with a 1-hour expiration
        cache.set(cache_key, tide_info, expire=3600)

        return tide_info
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching NOAA tidal data: {e}")
        return {}
```

---

### **🎯 How This Works**
1. **Check Cache First** 🛠️  
   - If data exists in the cache and is fresh (less than **1 hour old**), return it.  

2. **Fetch from NOAA API if Cache is Empty** 🌐  
   - If data is **not** in the cache, fetch from NOAA, store in cache, and return.  

3. **Expiration** ⏳  
   - Cached data **expires after 1 hour** (3600 seconds) to ensure fresh data.  

---

### **📌 Next Steps**
✅ Test this by calling `get_noaa_data(station_id="9445958")` multiple times and observing that **subsequent calls are faster** and **skip API requests**.  
✅ If needed, we can extend caching to **WeatherAgent** as well.  

Would you like to add caching for **WeatherAgent** too? 🚀
